## System requirements

Your system should have the Skyscraper recommended specs (2.0 GHz or better CPU, 2 GB or more RAM, 64+ MB RAM on video card) to optimize your experience, although minimum requirements (1.0 GHz CPU, 512 MB RAM, 32 MB video card RAM) will get you by.

My specs are listed below, just in case you need them.
> OS:  Mac OS X 10.8.2 (15" Early 2011 MacBook Pro)
> CPU: 2.0 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 with Turbo Boost
> GPU: Intel HD Graphics 3000, 384 MB VRAM and AMD Radeon HD 6490M, 256 MB VRAM (automatic graphics card switching - Generally the AMD card is used in S-Sim.)

## HOW TO INSTALL in Skyscraper without cloning

___Note:_ This assumes that you have correctly installed Skyscraper CS 9/13/12 or later and the latest edition of [G1DP](http://gooper1datapack.weebly.com/downloads.html)! See the wiki article for a complete tutorial.__

1. Download the repository. To do that, click the ZIP button at the top to download `chiefbozx-Skyscraper-[#######].zip` (`#######` is the commit number). Or go to the [downloads page](https://github.com/chiefbozx/Skyscraper/downloads) for notable versions of the pack (which are usually just old commits) and single buildings.
2. Extract the ZIP file to your `skyscraper/buildings` folder. Overwrite everything if prompted.
3. In Skyscraper, click "Other building" and then choose the `.bld` file to run it. Old files are in `/chiefbozx-old/[project name]`.

## HOW TO INSTALL by cloning the repository

If you know how to clone the repository, click the Clone button. Target your save to the `skyscraper/buildings` folder and name it appropriately (`chiefbozx` is a good title). Do note that you will be navigating through an extra layer of folders to get to my stuff if you clone! To update, just pull from GitHub to your clone. Again make sure you have G1DP.

## A note about data

My stuff depends on the Skyscraper textures included in the [Gooper1 Data Pack](http://gooper1datapack.weebly.com/downloads.html). Download the latest version of the G1DP Base Pack and the G1DP Buildings Add-On Pack and extract everything to your root (Skyscraper) folder. See the wiki or G1DP's help page for help on that.

# Developing

Anyone is welcome to fork the project and submit pull requests. Make sure that you submit a pull request to the correct branch (use `master` for generic updates, otherwise make sure that the branch aligns - like use `Tower X` for Tower X). You'll be added automatically to the network tree to show that you're awesome. People who contribute a __lot__ of useful stuff may be added directly as collaborators.

# SSF

This repository is linked to on SSF as another method of sharing it, however SSF is NOT where issues are tracked! Use the issue tracker instead. SSF is more of a general comment area.

# Thanks

Thank you for checking out and downloading my projects. Be sure to check back often as I release updates every now and then with tons of cool stuff. Enjoy!
